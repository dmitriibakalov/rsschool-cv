## About Myself:
### At the beginning of my career, after graduating from University, I worked as a mining engineer in Saint-Petersburg (Russia). Spent my free time studying chemistry because it has fascinated me since childhood. After working for 10 years in the subway construction industry, decided to change my life and in 2019, my family and I moved to Lisbon (Portugal).<p> <p> My passion for chemistry helped me find a job in Portugal as an analytical chemist at Zilmo Lda. My responsibilities include: perfoming chemical sample analysis, sample collection, data processing and reporting functions.<p> <p> Since 2020, I have been additionally studying computer programs related to chemistry. And in 2022 started the JS Frontend Development for beginners online course. I believe, that my ability to learn and to gain new skills will lead me through this path of becoming a proficient Frontend Developer.
